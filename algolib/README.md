# AlgoLib

Commonly used algorithms, programmed in a generic fashion with pointers to data compare function and data is declared as void type.
It also contains example of implementations for common graph operations (BFS/DFS, add/remove vertexes, add/remove edges etc), sorting function comparison.
Most comments and stdout messages are in Romanian but the main implementation is in english.

## Features:

- insertion sort
- quick sort
- merge sort
- counting sort
- radix sort
- graphs implementation
- DFS/BFS Breadth First Search/Depth first search
- add/remove/insert vertex
- add/remove/insert edges
- adjacent graphs
- list and queues with similar operations
- sets
- generic data functions
- generic data compare functions
